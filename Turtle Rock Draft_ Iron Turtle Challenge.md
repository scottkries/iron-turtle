**Turtle Rock Draft: Iron Turtle Challenge**  
Rules:

1. **Scores** will be tracked from arrival at Dick’s Burgers (\~12 pm Friday) through one hour before the draft begins (\~2 pm Sunday). In the final hour before the draft, each team will tally scores. The higher the score, the higher the draft order selection.   
   1. Scores are tracked individually. Please follow the Irish honor system when tracking your own points and record them as truthfully as possible.  
   2. Points for teams of multiple managers will be finalized as the average of points attained by each of the team’s managers.  
2. **Consumables** may be consumed in any quantity with no limits.  
3. **Competitions** may be completed an unlimited number of times.  
   1. Co-managers may not participate *against* each other in competitions   
4. **Tasks** may only receive credit for one completion, like in Yahtzee. For example, you cannot hike up and down Turtle Rock all day—you may only collect points for that task a single time.   
   1. There are specified exceptions for random tasks  
5. **Multipliers** stack. If you do something on the water between 2am and 8 am wearing USC gear, your multiplier would be 12x.  
6. **Challenges**:  
   1. Should there be a rules dispute in any aspect of the Iron Turtle Challenge (including disputes within competitions), any participating or observing player may initiate a challenge by throwing his red challenge flag  
      1. Tough titty if you don’t have your challenge flag with you bozo  
   2. When a challenge has begun, all who witnessed the disputed event may vote (or abstain).   
      1. Should a supermajority (60+%) of witnesses be attained, the dispute will go in favor of the supermajority  
         1. Teams with multiple managers may only be represented by a single vote towards a disputed decision  
      2. Should a supermajority be unattainable, the dispute may be resolved by the chugoff of a single beer/seltzer in the manner of the challenger’s preference (shotgun, out of a cup, out of a can, etc.)  
         1. Chugoff beers count towards points  
      3. If the challenger is successful, he may keep his challenge flag towards future challenges. If the challenger is unsuccessful, he loses his challenge flag for 12 hours  
      4. In addition to any points that need distribution based on the result of the challenge’s resolution, the winner of the challenge will receive a \+10 point bonus and the loser will lose \-10 points.   
7. **Penalties**  
   1. When a penalty is committed, players may self-identify or be caught  
   2. Penalties DOUBLE if caught by another player instead of self-reported  
   3. When someone is caught committing a penalty, another player may “catch” them by throwing the yellow flag  
      1. If you don’t have your flag on you suck a fat one you not catching shit  
   4. Penalties may be challenged if the accused has a challenge flag to throw  
8. **Linda and Russ**  
   1. At any time, Linda and Russ may assign arbitrary bonus points or penalties. However, you may not REMIND them to offer you points nor ASK for them. Must be completely on their own prerogative.
