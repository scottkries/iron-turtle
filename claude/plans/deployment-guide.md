## Netlify Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Project Files (5 minutes)
**File Structure Check**:
```
iron-turtle/
├── index.html          # Main application file
├── css/
│   └── style.css       # Custom styles
├── js/
│   ├── app.js          # Main application logic
│   ├── activities.js   # Activity database
│   └── scoring.js      # Scoring calculations
└── README.md           # Optional documentation
```

**Pre-deployment Verification**:
- [ ] All file paths are relative (no absolute paths)
- [ ] Bootstrap CDN links are working
- [ ] No references to localhost or local files
- [ ] All images/assets are included in project folder

### 2. Create Netlify Account (2 minutes)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub, GitLab, or email
3. Verify email if required
4. Access dashboard

### 3. Deploy via Drag & Drop (3 minutes)
1. **Compress project folder**: 
   - Zip the iron-turtle folder contents (not the folder itself)
   - OR simply have all files ready in one folder
2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Find "Want to deploy a new site?" section
   - Drag project folder or ZIP file to deployment area
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
3. **Get URL**:
   - Netlify assigns random URL (e.g., `amazing-turtle-123.netlify.app`)
   - Note this URL for testing and sharing

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional - 5 minutes)
**If you want a custom domain**:
1. Go to site dashboard → Domain settings
2. Add custom domain (requires domain ownership)
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Deployment Issues
**Site won't load**:
- Check for JavaScript console errors
- Verify all file paths are relative
- Ensure index.html is in root directory

**Features not working**:
- Test locally first to isolate deployment vs. code issues
- Check browser developer console for errors
- Verify Bootstrap CDN links are loading

### Performance Issues
**Slow loading**:
- Check internet connection on test device
- Verify CDN resources are loading quickly
- Consider simplifying initial page load

**Search/UI sluggish**:
- Test with smaller activity database first
- Check for JavaScript performance bottlenecks
- Verify device has sufficient memory available

### Data Issues
**Activities not saving**:
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Verify data structure in browser dev tools
- Test on different browsers/devices

**Scoring incorrect**:
- Compare calculations to physical scoring sheet
- Test individual multiplier combinations
- Verify all activity data was transcribed correctly
